### The Objective
To analyze key trends, KPI's and sales for a coffee shop chain in New York City. The locations are Hell's Kitchen, Astoria, and Lower Manhattan 

### The Findings:
- Hell's Kitchen location has the highest sales, their leading product being sustainably grown coffee in the size large
- In all stores, barista espresso is the top selling product
- Astoria's location has the least amount of sales
- Coffee outperforms all coffee shop products (coffee sells better than pastries, teas, etc)
- The average sale per transaction is around $4.70 USD

### The Why 
- The peak hours for the most amount of sales is from 7AM to 10AM, most people would want to buy coffee first thing in the morning as opposed to tea or shakes
- Hot brewed coffee is cheaper than a fancy iced latte, cost may be important to the customer as NYC is generally expensive
- Barista espresso is quick and easy to make, perfect for working professionals on the go
- June is the busiest month of the year, this would mean more people are spending time outside, more tourists, more iced drinks are sold
- The hour with the least amount of sales is 8PM

  ## The Strategy
  - Consider keeping a staple barista blend espresso and coffee, it's simple and cost-effective to keep and is the highest performing product. This will also be a choice for customers who do not like to spend $8 USD on a fancy latte
  - Consider store hours of operations, the highest amount of sales are from 7AM-10AM, it will be cost effective to close the shop early instead of keeping the store open where sales are at it's lowest
  - Open the patio (if applicable) for outdoor seating during the summer. These are the busiest times of the year, providing various seating options is crucial for sales
  - Consider having seasonal beverages during the year, especially during the summer months. Think about having a lemonade, sparkling drink, or smoothie to quench the customer's thirst during the hot climate. Hot chocolate is also popular, so consider having different flavours during the year such as peppermint hot chocolate for christmas or lavendar hot chocolate for valentines day.
  - Get rid of packaged merchandise such as chocolate bars, syrups, etc. Conduct market research before implementing a "market" for packaged merchandise at the coffee shop
- develop a membership program for loyal customers to gain loyalty points, birthday drinks, and discounted drinks during the season
- Offering discounts on soon-to-be expiring drink flavours during seasonal transitions and pastries (or day old pastries) to get rid of the stock instead of throwing them away
- implementing wi-fi (if applicable) and seating with ports on the table for professionals and students
- Develop a trendier yet aesthetic interior design will help drive up sales through social media
